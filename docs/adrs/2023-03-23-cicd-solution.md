## Status

__PROPOSED__

## Context

We need to dicide on a CI/CD solution for our project, so we can automate certain tasks, e.g., building, testing, releasing, etc..

## Decision

We decided to use Github Action Workflows because we already use Github for other related tasks, such as branch naming and protection rules, and therfore we have all of our configuration in one place.

## Consequences

What are the consequences of the change? What will be more difficult? What will be easier?
